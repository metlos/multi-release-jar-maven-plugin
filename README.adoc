== Multi Release JAR Maven Plugin

WARN: DO NOT USE THIS EXTENSION. It was meant as a quick hack to enable multi-release support in Maven until this is better supported in Maven itself. There is now a number of ways to construct multi-release jars, each of which is less hacky and more maintainable than this solution. Please consult https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-compiler-plugin/multirelease.html for more information.

Java 9 has been released but Maven still lacks support for multirelease JARs.

There are solutions to build them using existing Maven plugins (like
http://in.relation.to/2017/02/13/building-multi-release-jars-with-maven[this] or
http://word-bits.flurg.com/multrelease-jars/[this]) but they all lack the flexibility
and features of the standard maven compiler plugin.

This plugin is a quick and dirty solution to the current lack of tooling. It introduces
a new packaging and a new source directory to build multi-release jars with the full
feature set of the maven compiler plugin.

=== Getting Started

NOTE: For all this to work, you need to run Maven using Java 9.

First, you need to define this plugin as a build extension in your POM.

```xml
<build>
  <extensions>
    <extension>
      <groupId>pw.krejci</groupId>
      <artifactId>multi-release-jar-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>...</version>
    </extension>
  </extensions>
  ...
```

Next, you need to change the packaging of your module to

```xml
<packaging>multi-release-jar</packaging>
```

And that's it for the basic setup in `pom.xml`.

Now you need to actually add your sources for different java releases.
For each java release, the corresponding sources should go into `java-mr/<RELEASE-NUMBER>`. E.g. for Java 9 you put
the Java 9 specific sources into `src/main/java-mr/9` directory.

Now when you compile the module, classes from `src/main/java` will be normally put into the jar while classes from
`src/main/java-mr/9` will end up in `META-INF/versions/9` of the resulting jar.

=== Controlling Compilation

The `multi-release-jar-maven-plugin` `compile` goal has the same configuration properties as the classic
`maven-compiler-plugin`.

To compile the main sources as Java 8, you need to configure it as you would the maven compiler plugin, i.e. either
using properties `maven.compiler.source` and `maven.compiler.target` set to `1.8`

```xml
<properties>
  <maven.compiler.source>1.8</maven.compiler.source>
  <maven.compiler.target>1.8</maven.compiler.target>
</properties>
```

or by configuring the plugin itself like so:

```xml
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>pw.krejci</groupId>
      <artifactId>multi-release-jar-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>...</version>
      <configuration>
        <source>1.8</source>
        <target>1.8</source>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
    ...
```

To provide different configuration properties to the compiler when compiling for different than the default release,
you can use:

```xml
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>pw.krejci</groupId>
      <artifactId>multi-release-jar-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>...</version>
      <configuration>
        <perReleaseConfiguration>
          <release>9</release>
          <configuration>
            <compilerArguments>
              <arg>-Xlint</arg>
            </compilerArguments>
          </configuration>
        </perReleaseConfiguration>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
    ...
```

The main configuration supports all properties of the maven compiler plugin but only a handful of properties can be
modified for per-release compiler configurations:

* https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-compiler-plugin/compile-mojo.html#compilerArguments[compilerArguments]
* https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-compiler-plugin/compile-mojo.html#compilerArgs[compilerArgs]


=== Controlling Module Info

Module info class(es) can be located in any (or all) of the parts of the multi-release jar. If the main classes are
compiled for Java 8, you cannot easily compile `module-info.java` together with the rest of the classes though you maybe
would like to. Having a `module-info.class` in the root of the jar makes it a module by default. If you had the
`module-info.class` only in one (or more) of the version directories, that module info would be valid only when run with
the corresponding java version.

To compile for Java 8 by default but have a module-info.class also in the root of the jar, you can do the following:

```xml
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>pw.krejci</groupId>
      <artifactId>multi-release-jar-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>...</version>
      <configuration>
        <source>1.8</source>
        <target>1.8</target>
        <mainModuleInfo>9</mainModuleInfo>
        ...
      </configuration>
      ...
```

Your `module-info.java` would be located in `src/main/java-mr/9` but would end up compiled in the root of the jar after
compilation and packaging instead of `META-INF/versions/9` as it would without the `mainModuleInfo` configuration
property.
